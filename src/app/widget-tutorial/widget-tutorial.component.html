<h1>
  Welcome to KIP!
</h1>

<p>If you want to dive right in to see what KIP can do, you can use this button to load demo configuration:</p>
<button mat-raised-button routerLink="/demo">Load Demo</button>

<div *ngIf="!unlockStatus">
  <h2>Unlocking</h2>
  <p>
    KIP is "Locked" by default. This is to prevent accidental interaction from touch screens from changing anything. 
    You can unlock KIP using the gear icon in the lower right corner and selecting "Unlock". Go Ahead try it now!
  </p>
</div>
<div *ngIf="unlockStatus">
  <h2>Configuring</h2>
  <p>
    Now that KIP is unlocked, you can do a few actions. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The icon in the lower right can be used to select the Widget you would like to display</li>
    <li>The icon in the lower left can be used to "split" the existing area. You can use this to display multiple items on one page</li>
    <li>The "X" in the upper right can be used to delete an area (basically undoing a split)</li>
    <li>Once a widget is selected, there will be a gear in the lower middle. Clicking it will allow you to setup the widget parameters</li>
  </ul>

  
</div>
